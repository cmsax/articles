However, we still need to spend a lot of time to configurate generators and build our sites locally then publish/upload it to host.</p>
<p>With the help of continuous-integration platform, we may let the CI platform do the devil jobs. We just write markdowns, send them to the pipeline, then we are free to go.</p>
<p>So I started a project called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/cmsax/articles"><code>Articles</code></a>, it can automatically build your articles on the cloud with continuous deployment.</p>
<p>You just concentrate on writing and never install <code>npm</code> or <code>Hexo</code> on your machine.</p>
<p><code>Articles</code> is enpowered by Hexo, <code>GitHub pages</code> and currently <code>Travis-CI</code>. You write the articles locally, and we build &amp; publish your articles according your config.</p>
