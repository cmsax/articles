### Work

- A python project, watch DBF files then push data to Kafka.
  - Existing DBF packages cannot handle column missing issue thus will extract wrong data. I work around this by reading bytes according to pre-defined rules.

### TWIL

This week I learn:

- I read {seven concurrency models in seven weeks}

### To be done in next week

- LeetCode
- Read source code of `asyncio`

### Things Can Be Improved

- Less LOL
- More sleep
